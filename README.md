## What It Does
The purpose of this app is to provide students with a more affordable opertunity to get to school. When a student request a ride it will locate the clossest student to provide one. 
Ideally, they would be in the same apartment complex or dorm. The reason students would sign up for the app is becasue they are already going to class or the football game, might as well get your gas paid for.
